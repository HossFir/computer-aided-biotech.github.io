abstract = {Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius represents a thermophilic, facultative anaerobic bacterial chassis, with several desirable traits for metabolic engineering and industrial production. To further optimize strain productivity, a systems level understanding of its metabolism is needed, which can be facilitated by a genome-scale metabolic model. Here, we present p-thermo, the most complete, curated and validated genome-scale model (to date) of Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius NCIMB 11955. It spans a total of 890 metabolites, 1175 reactions and 917 metabolic genes, forming an extensive knowledge base for P. thermoglucosidasius NCIMB 11955 metabolism. The model accurately predicts aerobic utilization of 22 carbon sources, and the predictive quality of internal fluxes was validated with previously published 13C-fluxomics data. In an application case, p-thermo was used to facilitate more in-depth analysis of reported metabolic engineering efforts, giving additional insight into fermentative metabolism. Finally, p-thermo was used to resolve a previously uncharacterised bottleneck in anaerobic metabolism, by identifying the minimal required supplemented nutrients (thiamin, biotin and iron(III)) needed to sustain anaerobic growth. This highlights the usefulness of p-thermo for guiding the generation of experimental hypotheses and for facilitating data-driven metabolic engineering, expanding the use of P. thermoglucosidasius as a high yield production platform.}

              the long-term (100 s of hours) response of Saccharomyces

              strain and a recombinant strain, expressing an insulin precursor,
              were cultured in the scale-down system, and analyzed at the
              physiological and proteomic level. Phenotypes of both strains
              were compared with those observed in a well-mixed chemostat. Our
              results show that S. cerevisiae subjected to long-term chemostat
              conditions undergoes a global reproducible shift in its cellular

              environments is a hallmark of living systems. As metabolism is
              complex, mechanistic models have gained popularity for describing
              the dynamic response of cellular metabolism and for identifying
              target genes for engineering. At the same time, the detailed
              tracking of transient metabolism in living cells on the subminute
              time scale has become amenable using dynamic nuclear
              polarization-enhanced 13C NMR. Here, we suggest an approach

              without running resource-intensive experiments. While these

              production hosts like Escherichia coli and S. cerevisiae, few
              such models exist for one-carbon (C1) metabolizers. Results:
              Here, we present a genome-scale metabolic model for Methylococcus
              capsulatus (Bath), a well-studied obligate methanotroph, which
              has been used as a production strain of single cell protein
              (SCP). The model was manually curated, and spans a total of 879
              metabolites connected via 913 reactions. The inclusion of 730
              genes and comprehensive annotations, make this model not only a
              useful tool for modeling metabolic physiology, but also a
              centralized knowledge base for M. capsulatus (Bath). With it, we
              determined that oxidation of methane by the particulate methane
              monooxygenase could be driven both through direct coupling or
              uphill electron transfer, both operating at reduced efficiency,
              as either scenario matches well with experimental data and

              will serve the ongoing fundamental research of C1 metabolism, and

              However, engineering microbial strains to overproduce a compound
              of interest can be a long, costly and painstaking process. If

              Strategies for coupling production to growth, however, are often
              not trivial to find. Here we present OptCouple, a
              constraint-based modeling algorithm to simultaneously identify
