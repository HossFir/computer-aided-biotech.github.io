	abstract = {Cells cultured in a nutrient-limited environment can undergo adaptation, which confers improved fitness under long-term energy limitation. We have previously shown how a recombinant S. cerevisiae strain, producing a heterologous insulin product, under glucose-limited conditions adapts over time at the average population level.In this paper, we investigated this adaptation at the single-cell level by application of FACS and showed that three apparent phenotypes underlie the adaptive response observed at the bulk level: (1) cells that drastically reduced insulin production (23 \%), (2) cells with reduced enzymatic capacity in central carbon metabolism (46 \%), (3) cells that exhibited pseudohyphal growth (31 \%). We speculate that the phenotypic heterogeneity is a result of different mechanisms to increase fitness. Cells with reduced insulin productivity have increased fitness by reducing the burden of the heterologous insulin production and the populations with reduced enzymatic capacity of the central carbon metabolism and pseudohyphal growth have increased fitness towards the glucose-limited conditions.The results highlight the importance of considering population heterogeneity when studying adaptation and evolution.Competing Interest StatementThe authors Naia Risager Wright and Nanna Petersen Ronnest were employed by the company Novo Nordisk A/S. The remaining authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.},

	abstract = {Tolerance to high product concentrations is a major barrier to achieving economically viable processes for bio-based chemical production. Chemical tolerance mechanisms are often unknown, thus their rational design is not achievable. To reveal unknown tolerance mechanisms we used an automated platform to evolve Escherichia coli to grow in previously toxic concentrations of 11 chemicals that have applications as polymer precursors, chemical intermediates, or biofuels. Re-sequencing of isolates from 88 independently evolved populations, reconstruction of mutations, and cross-compound tolerance profiling was employed to uncover general and specific tolerance mechanisms. We found that: 1) the broad tolerance of strains towards chemicals varied significantly depending on the chemical stress condition under which the strain was evolved; 2) the strains that acquired high levels of NaCl tolerance also became broadly tolerant to most chemicals; 3) genetic tolerance mechanisms included alterations in regulatory, cell wall, transcriptional and translational functions, as well as more chemical-specific mechanisms related to transport and metabolism; 4) using pre-tolerized starting strains can significantly enhance subsequent production of chemicals when a production pathway is inserted; and 5) only a subset of the evolved isolates showed improved production indicating that this approach is especially useful when a large number of independently evolved isolates are screened for production. We provide a comprehensive genotype-phenotype map based on identified mutations and growth phenotypes for 224 chemical tolerant strains.},
